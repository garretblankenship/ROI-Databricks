    "**Expectations** are data quality checks built into your Lakeflow pipeline.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **What are expectations?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "* Declarative data quality rules\n",
    "* SQL-like conditions that data must meet\n",
    "* Applied to streaming tables and views\n",
    "* Monitored and tracked automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@dlt.table(\n",
    "    expect={\"valid_amount\": \"total_amount > 0\"}\n",
    ")\n",
    "def silver_bookings():\n",
    "    return dlt.read_stream(\"bronze_bookings\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this does:**\n",
    "* Checks that `total_amount > 0` for every row\n",
    "* Tracks violations\n",
    "* Takes action based on expectation type\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why use expectations?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without expectations:**\n",
    "* ❌ Bad data flows through pipeline\n",
    "* ❌ Issues discovered late (in dashboards)\n",
    "* ❌ Manual data quality checks\n",
    "* ❌ No visibility into data quality\n",
    "\n",
    "**With expectations:**\n",
    "* ✅ Catch issues early\n",
    "* ✅ Automatic data quality monitoring\n",
    "* ✅ Prevent bad data from propagating\n",
    "* ✅ Built-in metrics and reporting\n",
    "* ✅ Self-documenting data quality rules\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Where to use expectations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* 🥉 **Bronze:** Minimal (track issues, don't drop)\n",
    "* 🥈 **Silver:** Extensive (drop invalid data)\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Writing Good Expectations**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do:**\n",
    "* ✅ Use descriptive names: `valid_amount`, not `check1`\n",
    "* ✅ One rule per expectation\n",
    "* ✅ Simple, clear conditions\n",
    "* ✅ Test expectations before deploying\n",
    "* ✅ Document why expectation exists\n",
    "\n",
    "**Don't:**\n",
    "* ❌ Complex multi-condition checks in one expectation\n",
    "* ❌ Too many expectations (5-10 max per table)\n",
    "* ❌ Expectations that always fail\n",
    "* ❌ Duplicate checks across layers\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Expectation Naming**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good names:**\n",
    "* `valid_amount` - Clear what it checks\n",
    "* `positive_price` - Descriptive\n",
    "* `required_email` - Indicates requirement\n",
    "* `valid_date_range` - Explains validation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bad names:**\n",
    "* `check1` - Not descriptive\n",
    "* `test` - Unclear purpose\n",
    "* `exp` - Too generic\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Performance Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expectations impact performance:**\n",
    "* Each expectation = additional computation\n",
    "* Complex conditions = slower processing\n",
    "* Many expectations = more overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimize:**\n",
    "* ✅ Keep conditions simple\n",
    "* ✅ Limit to 5-10 expectations per table\n",
    "* ✅ Use indexed columns when possible\n",
    "* ✅ Combine related checks\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Testing Expectations**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before production:**\n",
    "1. Start with `expect()` to understand violations\n",
    "2. Review violation rates\n",
    "3. Adjust thresholds if needed\n",
    "4. Change to `expect_or_drop()` when ready\n",
    "5. Use `expect_or_fail()` only for critical rules\n",

    "### **What You Learned:**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Expectations concept** - Declarative data quality rules  \n",
    "✅ **expect()** - Track violations, keep records  \n",
    "✅ **expect_or_drop()** - Filter invalid data  \n",
    "✅ **expect_or_fail()** - Halt on critical issues  \n",
    "✅ **Combining expectations** - Multiple types on one table  \n",
    "✅ **Monitoring metrics** - View quality in UI  \n",
    "✅ **Best practices** - When and how to use each type  \n",
    "✅ **Common patterns** - Reusable expectation templates  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Expectations are declarative** - Define rules, Lakeflow enforces\n",
    "2. **Three types for three actions** - Track, drop, or fail\n",
    "3. **Bronze tracks, silver drops, gold fails** - General pattern\n",
    "4. **Metrics are automatic** - No manual tracking needed\n",
    "5. **Combine types for flexibility** - Different rules, different actions\n",
    "6. **Start lenient, get stricter** - expect → expect_or_drop → expect_or_fail\n",
    "7. **Monitor trends** - Increasing violations = upstream issues\n",
